# XO Game Collection

This project is a collection of tic-tac-toe-inspired games built in C++ and Python. It includes traditional and unique game modes (like Pyramid XO, Word XO, Ultimate XO), alongside a Python GUI-based version.

## 🎮 Game Modes
- Standard 3x3 Tic Tac Toe
- 4x4 and 5-in-a-row versions
- Word-based and Pyramid-based XO
- Inverse mode, Numerical XO, and more
- Python GUI version (`four.py`)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- C++ (OOP-based structure)
- Python (GUI using Tkinter or similar)

## 🗂️ File Structure
- `Normal/` — C++ console game modes
- `GUI/four.py` — Python GUI implementation
- `.pdf` — Original assignment/project brief (optional for review)

## 🚀 How to Run

### C++ Games
Use a C++ compiler and CMake:
```bash
cmake .
make
./main
```

### Python GUI Game
```bash
cd GUI
python3 four.py
```
